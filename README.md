# portfolio

When creating my web portfolio, there were many aspects I was already completly familiar with as I've been doing *HTML* and *CSS* coding for some time now. I instantly knew how to setup my code, and how to begin displaying my title, any written information and my photos. The *CSS* tends to take the longest time to do; even after having lots of experience with it. Determining sizes and colors of everything on the website can be a tricky process. I decided also to place a border around each of my photos as it would make them pop out more to the viewers, and would also help out anyone with accessibility issues.
The thing I struggled with the most was **definitly** the bootstrap elements on the website. Seeing as it was the newest thing we learnt in class it makes sence that it was also the trickiest. I had to rewatch the in-class lessons to try and figure out how I could incorporate the bootstrap elements into my website. When re-watching the classes I found solutions to my problems and figured out how to link it into my code and how to allow myself to use it.
